He is going to masturbate. Get over it. Don't try to catch him, and don't shame him. 2. He will watch porn. It's too easy to access to avoid it. If that offends you, you need to talk to him about porn. Not specifics, but don't shame him for wanting to see naked women and learn how sec works. 3. When he gets to be about 13 or 14 you need to show him how to properly use a condom. You're not authorizing use, just being safe. Be scientific about it, so nobody is embarrassed. 4. When you teach him to shave, don't use a pink razor or pink shaving cream. 5. When you take him clothes shopping, don't physically check the fit on him yourself. Ask him if they fit. 6. Acne sucks, teach him to wash his face but don't use girly soap. 7. Take him to get his hair cut. Take him to places designed for men. Sports clips, knockouts, or a barber. Not a hair salon. 8. Don't give him girly chores (don't split hairs here you know what I mean). Have him now the yard, take out the trash, pick up after the dog... the gross stuff. 9. Teach him to respect women other than you in a romantic sense. 10. Stop being overly physically affectionate. No more cuddles or him sleeping with you or hanging out in your bedroom or his. He needs to have a private space. Random erections (for no reason) happen. He does not need to be touching you in any capacity if they do. ",

You have both communicated your positions to each other. Now you have to decide if it's a deal breaker for you or not. If yes, break up. If not, then you need to learn to deal with it.

Good for 2, maybe 3 more after that if I push it, but the quality on the last two orgasms is way down and the quality of the dicking is also somewhat reduced. I believe once the stars aligned and we started having sex early enough in the day and she was libidinous and robust enough that we went around 7-8 orgasms worth on my end and we lost count on her end, but this was over the course of late afternoon to the wee hours and involved a few breaks and then a power nap before the finale around 5 am.
